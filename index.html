							<h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
							<p>Bitcoin is an internet protocol that enables the transfer of value over a communications channel like the Internet or radio.
							<p>One of its first applications is as a decentralized digital currency. Think of it like being able to send a gold coin as easy as you send an email.
							<p>But there will be a lot more applications of this blockchain technology. It will enable all types of amazing things like self-driving cars that are able to pick up passengers and pay for their own maintenance.
							<p>Or a refrigerator that is able to pay for groceries to restock itself.</p>
